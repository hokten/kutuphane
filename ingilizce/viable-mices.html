<h3>Viable mice created from two female eggs</h3>
					
						<p>
A surprising number of animals can <span title="türetmek." style="cursor:pointer;font-weight:bold;color:red;">reproduce</span> via a process called
parthenogenesis, in which females <span title="üretmek." style="cursor:pointer;font-weight:bold;color:red;">produce</span> <span title="yaşayabilir;tutarlı;uygun." style="cursor:pointer;font-weight:bold;color:blue;">viable</span> and <span title="verimli,mümbit;doğurgan" style="cursor:pointer;font-weight:bold;color:red;">fertile</span> offspring
without getting a male <span title="gerektirmek;bağlamak;ihata etmek;içermek;ihtiva etmek." style="cursor:pointer;font-weight:bold;color:red;">involve</span>d. <span title="Buna rağmen;bununla beraber" style="cursor:pointer;font-weight:bold;color:red;">Although</span> this is <span title="Seyrek olarak;nadiren." style="cursor:pointer;font-weight:bold;color:red;">rarely</span> the
reproductive method of choice, even <span title="Omurgalı;bel kemiği olan." style="cursor:pointer;font-weight:bold;color:red;">vertebrate</span>s such as sharks and
<span title="kertenkele." style="cursor:pointer;font-weight:bold;color:red;">lizard</span>s have reproduced without males when sexual reproduction wasn't
an option in zoos and aquariums. Parthenogenesis doesn't seem to be an
option in <span title="memeliler." style="cursor:pointer;font-weight:bold;color:red;">mammals</span>, <span title="gerçi;her ne kadar;olmasına rağmen." style="cursor:pointer;font-weight:bold;color:blue;">though</span>, as both male and female mammals modify the
genomes in their <span title="mikrop;tohum;asıl;öz." style="cursor:pointer;font-weight:bold;color:red;">germ</span> cells in ways that cause <span title="dayanıklı;sağlam;sürekli." style="cursor:pointer;font-weight:bold;color:red;">lasting</span> changes in their
expression, a process termed <span title="baskı;etki;tesir." style="cursor:pointer;font-weight:bold;color:red;">imprint</span>ing. But a research team has now
<span title="hesaplamak;düşünerek sonuca varma." style="cursor:pointer;font-weight:bold;color:red;">figured out</span> a way of avoiding these problems, and have <a href="http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nbt1331.html">created mice with two mothers</a>, and no <span title="bağlılık,ilgi,alaka." style="cursor:pointer;font-weight:bold;color:red;">involvement</span> with a father.
</p>
<p> The researchers built this <span title="büyük ilerleme yada buluş;devrim." style="cursor:pointer;font-weight:bold;color:red;">breakthrough</span> on two pieces of knowledge.
The first is that cells <span title="başlangıçta;ilk zamanlarda." style="cursor:pointer;font-weight:bold;color:red;">early on</span> the path to oocyte (egg cell)
development haven't been imprinted yet. The second is that researchers
have identified a small number of areas in the genome that undergo
opposite imprinting in the two sexes. The researchers generated mice
<span title="götürmek;yük çekmek;sürüklemek." style="cursor:pointer;font-weight:bold;color:red;">carry</span>ing <span title="silme;bozma." style="cursor:pointer;font-weight:bold;color:blue;">deletion</span>s of two of the imprinted areas, and then isolated
early oocytes that had not started the imprinting process from these
mice. </p>
<p>
These cells could be <span title="eriyip birbiriyle kaynaşmak." style="cursor:pointer;font-weight:bold;color:red;">fused with</span> a normal oocyte, creating a cell with a
normal diploid genome. When those cells were activated to divide, they
produced apparently normal early embryos. Once implanted into female
mice, the embryos survived to adulthood at rates roughly comparable to
those produced by <em>in vitro</em>
fertilization. The biggest difference appears to be a reduction in
their growth rates—adults wound up 20 percent smaller than normal mice.
This isn't much of a surprise, given that imprinting is one of the ways
that <a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/science.ars/2007/07/10/evolutionary-battleground-the-placenta">males and females compete</a> for providing the appropriate amount of resources for their offspring.
</p>
<p>
It's not clear whether these mice are necessarily going to be useful
for any specific application, but they tell us two things. One is that
there appear to be only two regions of the genome that are imprinted in
a way that's essential for the control of embryonic development, which
should greatly simplify the study of that topic. The second is that the
lack of a male contribution has been proposed to be a key reason for
the low success rates of cloning and various forms of somatic cell
nuclear transplants. The results indicate that there's nothing magical
provided by the male other than the properly imprinted chromosomes. </p>
